# Robust Correlation Toolbox - in progress version

The toolbox computes robust correlations as in [Robust correlation analyses: false positive and power validation using a new open source Matlab toolbox](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00606/full) and includes updates on multiple comparisons following [Improved methods for making inferences about multiple skipped correlations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949655.2018.1501051).

Known issue: CI of skipped correlations are biased and should not be used for inference.

## in progress
- unify inputs/outputs
- fix CI 
- add comparison for correlations
 
## wishes
- R and python versions
